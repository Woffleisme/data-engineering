# Data Engineering Spectrogram GUI

This repository contains a simple Tkinter application for loading, slicing and saving spectrogram data stored as `.npy` files.

Run the GUI with:

```bash
python main.py
```

Use the interface to load one or more numpy arrays, apply average pooling, crop each spectrogram using the mouse and `c` key, and finally save all windows as a new array.
